# Project Euler 168

## Intro

This problem is a programming version of Problem 168 (http://projecteuler.net/problem=168) from projecteuler.net (http://projecteuler.net/)

Consider the number 142857. We can right-rotate this number by moving the last digit (7) to the front of it, giving us 714285. It can be verified that 714285 = 5 x 142857. This demonstrates an unusual property of 142857: it is a divisor of its right-rotation.

Find the last 5 digits of the sum of all integers n, 10 < n < 10^m, that have this property.

**Input Format**

One integer is given on first line representing m.

**Constraints**
2 <= m <= 100

**Output Format**
Print one integer which is the answer to the problem.

**Sample Input**
2

**Sample Output**
495
