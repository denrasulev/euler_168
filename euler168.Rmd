## Intro

This problem is a programming version of Problem 168 (http://projecteuler.net/problem=168) from projecteuler.net (http://projecteuler.net/)

Consider the number 142857. We can right-rotate this number by moving the last digit (7) to the front of it, giving us 714285. It can be verified that 714285 = 5 x 142857. This demonstrates an unusual property of 142857: it is a divisor of its right-rotation.

Find the last 5 digits of the sum of all integers n, 10 < n < 10^m, that have this property.

Input Format
One integer is given on first line representing m.

Constraints
2 <= m <= 100

Output Format
Print one integer which is the answer to the problem.

Sample Input
2

Sample Output
495

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
